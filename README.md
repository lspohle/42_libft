# libft
Libft is the first project of the core curriculum of the 42 network. The project is about coding a C library. It contains various general purpose functions. It is divided into a mandatory (libc and additional functions) and a bonus part (functions in terms of linked lists).
I'm a student at [42 Wolfsburg](https://42wolfsburg.de)
